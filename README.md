# Assignment 4: Process Scheduling
# Due: April 4th 2021

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Brief Description: 

In this project,  you will simulate the process scheduling part of an operating system.  
You will implement time-based scheduling,ignoring almost every other aspect of the OS. 
In particular, this project will involve the main executable alternating execution with user processes much as the dispatcher might in an OS. 
You may use message queues or semaphores for synchronization, your choice.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Invoking the solution:

oss should take in several command line options as follows:

oss -h 
oss [-h] [-s t] [-l f]

-h    Describe how the project should be run and then, terminate.
-s t  Indicate how many maximum seconds before the system terminates
-l f  Specify a particular name for the log file


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How to run the project: 

First, you will need to type "make" into the command prompt.
This will create the necessary .o files as well as the executable files.
Then, you type ./oss followed by any of the above options. 
Now, the program will run as expected.
To clean the project, type "make clean".
